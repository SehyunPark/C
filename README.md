# C-programming

These are the list of projects(including small assignments) I've done since 2016.

The order of the list is updated every time the new projects(assignments) are completed.

< 1. Find_max : Finding max integers between two integers >
< 2. Encryption : Encrypting letters in the input file using a key variable>
< 3. : >
