<squares.c>

**** this c file shows the result of the movement of one square ****

1. getting two input integers from users, it shows two squares with each side (integer size)

ex) if size1 = 9, size2 = 3 -> it shows the two squares each using '#' and '*'

2. getting two offset integers from users (x_offset & y_offset), it shows the result of the movements of the second square(size2)

ex) if x_offset = 1, y_offset = 1 -> it shows the result of the size2 square moved 'one side' in x-axis and y-axis

ex) this is the result of size1 = 4, size2 = 3, x_offset = 1, y_offset = 2
